# Bike Stores Revenue Analysis

This project is an analysis of the revenue generated by bike stores in different states over a period of one year. The data was collected from multiple sources and analyzed using SQL queries, Excel pivot tables and dashboard, and Tableau dashboards.

## Data Sources

The data for this project was obtained from the following sources:

- Bike store sales data: This data was collected from multiple bike stores located in different states across the US. The data includes information such as the date of sale, the store location, the product sold, and the sales revenue.

- State population data: This data was obtained from the US Census Bureau and includes the population of each state.

## Methodology

The data was first imported into a SQL database and cleaned and prepared using SQL queries. The prepared data was then exported to Excel where it was used to create pivot tables and charts to visualize the revenue generated by each store and state.

Tableau was then used to create interactive dashboards that provide a detailed analysis of the revenue generated by each store and state. The dashboards include filters that allow users to drill down into the data and view it from different perspectives.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed the following key findings:

- California generated the highest revenue of all the states, followed by New York and Texas.

- The top-performing store was located in Texas, California, generating over $2 million in revenue.

- The most popular product was the Road-750 bike, which generated over $1.5 million in revenue.

## Conclusion

Overall, the analysis shows that there is a significant variation in the revenue generated by bike stores in different states. By identifying the top-performing stores and products, bike store owners can make informed decisions about their inventory and marketing strategies to increase their revenue.
